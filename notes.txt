Clicking multiple times within the 1 sec transition between questions will still run the answerChecks from that question set.

Multiple clicks will still register in the question choices.

Possible fix is to set a variable called `isActive` with a boolean that switches when a button is clicked.
When switched, it will add `disabled` to class of clickable buttons.
`isActive` will change booleans again after the 1 sec setInterval.

Adding the `disabled` class to the bg change worked!!!

Answering a question as the time hits below 1 will put up a new question

Made another check for time in addq.

The results page will render twice, but not do anything outwardly

CSS and Layout is lacking...
